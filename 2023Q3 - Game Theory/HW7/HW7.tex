\textbf{BLPP Literature.} 
\textit{Identify and read a paper published within the last two years that (i) formulates a bilevel program to solve a problem and (ii) solves instances of the BLPP. Do not select a paper previously discussed within the course, including any papers shared by other students on Lesson 14.}


\subsubsection{}
\textit{Write your own summary of the authors work and its contributions to the BLPP literature.}


\subsubsection{}
\textit{Recommend an improvement to the authorsâ€™ model. Justify your recommendation in terms of its suitability for the application; its generalizability to other, related problems; its ability to be solved by selected methods; and/or its expected computational tractability by such methods.}


\subsubsection{}
\textit{For the existing model, identify an alternative solution methodology the authors could have (or perhaps should have) explored in comparison to their method(s). Justify your recommendation from the perspectives of optimization and implementation.}
