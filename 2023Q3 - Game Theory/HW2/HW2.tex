\textit{\textbf{Selfish and altruistic social behavior}. Two people enter a bus. Two adjacent cramped seats
	are free. Each person must decide whether to sit or stand. Sitting alone is more comfortable
	than sitting next to the other person, which is more comfortable than standing.}
	
	\subsubsection{}
	\textit{Suppose that each person cares only about her own comfort. Model the situation as a
	strategic game. Is this game the Prisoner’s Dilemma? Find its Nash equilibrium
	(equilibria?).}

	This is not a prisoner's dilemma type of game, it more similar to a coordination game.
	The Nash equilibrium in this game is [sit, sit].

	\textit{Suppose that each person is altruistic, ranking the outcomes according to the other
	person’s comfort, and, out of politeness, prefers to stand than to sit if the other person
	stands. Model the situation as a strategic game. Is this game the Prisoner’s Dilemma?
	Find its Nash equilibrium (equilibria?).}

	This situation is a prisoner's dilemma, there are Nash equilibria at [sit, sit] and [stand, stand].
	
	\subsubsection{}
	\textit{Compare the people’s comfort in the equilibria of the two games.} \\

	Because the rewards in each situation are ordinal, they may not accurately represent the proportional
	reward between each of the choices. Similarly the scale may be different between the two games.
	The mutually selfish equilibria are relatively equivalent between the two games, 
	and if the assumption that the [sit, sit] outcome is indeed identical between the two situations
	then the ordinality of the situations should be transitively preserved.
	If this is the case, then the highest utility is the mutually altruistic action(s), which ironically
	represent the lowest comfort game state. \\

\subsection{}
\textit{\textbf{Finding Nash equilibria for normal form games with continuous action spaces}. 
	Find the Nash equilibria of the two-player strategic game in which each player’s set of actions is the
	set of nonnegative numbers and the players’ payoff functions are}
	$u_1(a_1,a_2) =a_1(a_2-a_1)$ \textit{and} $u_2(a_1,a_2) = a_2(1-a_1-a_2)$.

	For player 1 we have,
	\begin{align*}
		u_1(a_1,a_2) &= a_1(a_2-a_1) \\
					 &= a_1a_2-a_1^2 \\
		\frac{\partial\,u_1(a_1,a_2)}{\partial\,a_2} &= a_2-2a_1.
	\end{align*}
	
	For player 2 we have,
	\begin{align*}
		u_2(a_1,a_2) &= a_2(1-a_1-a_2) \\
					 &= a_2-a_1a_2-a_2^2 \\
		\frac{\partial\,u_2(a_1,a_2)}{\partial\,a_2} &= 1-a_1-2a_2.
	\end{align*}
	
	Solving the two partials,
	\begin{align*}
		2a_1 &= a_2 = \frac{1-a_1}{2} \\
		4a_1 &= 1-a_1 \\
		5a_1 &= 1.
	\end{align*}

	And finally, we find Nash equilibrium where the combined player actions are represented by the vector
	\[\mathbf A = \begin{bmatrix} 0.2 \\0.4 \end{bmatrix}.\]

\subsection{}
\textit{\textbf{The Odd Couple}. Felix and Oscar share an apartment. They have decidedly different views
	on cleanliness and, hence, on whether or not they would be willing to put in the hours of
	work necessary to clean the apartment. Suppose that it takes at least twelve hours of work
	(per week) to keep the apartment clean, nine hours to make it livable, and anything less
	than nine hours leaves the apartment filthy. Suppose that each person can devote either
	three, six, or nine hours to cleaning.}
	
\textit{Felix and Oscar agree that a livable apartment is worth 2 on the utility index. They
	disagree on the value of clean apartment – Felix thinks it is worth 10 utils (i.e., utility units),
	while Oscar thinks it is worth only 5. They also disagree on the unpleasantness of a filthy
	apartment. Felix thinks it is worth -10 utils, while Oscar thinks it is worth -5. Each person’s
	payoff is the utility from the apartment minus the number of hours worked.}

\textit{Model this interaction as a normal form game and provide its matrix representation.
	Identify what each of the following solution concepts can tell you about how Felix and Oscar
	should play the game: (1) Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, (2) maxmin strategies, (3)
	minmax strategies, (4) minimax regret, (5) iterated dominance. Discuss the relationship
	between the various strategies.}

	\textit{Find the mixed strategy for Player 2 that maximally dominates strategy $B_2$. \\3ex %
%
	\underline{Hint}: You can readily solve this problem via a linear program that maximizes the
	minimum amount of domination over all possible Player 1 actions. As an example
	calculation, if Player 2 plays $(p_{A_2},p_{C_2},p_{D_2}) = (0.5,0.5,0)$, 
	the level of domination is $1 − 1 = 0$ for $A_1, 5.5 - 4 = 1.5$ for 
	$B_1, 0 - 0 = 0$ for $C_1$, and $1 − 0 = 1$ for $D_1$, resulting in a
	minimal level of domination of $0$ for this mixed strategy.}

	\subsubsection{}
	\textit{After eliminating $B_2$ from consideration, find the mixed strategy for Player 1 that
	maximally dominates strategy $C_1$.}

	\subsubsection{}
	\textit{After eliminating $C_1$ from consideration, eliminate iteratively the other strictly and
	weakly dominated strategies.}

	\textit{How many pure strategy Nash equilibria exist in the resulting, reduced game?}
