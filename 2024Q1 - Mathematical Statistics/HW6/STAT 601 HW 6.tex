	\question 
	A natural ancillary statistic in most problems is the sample size. 
	For example, let \(N\) be a random variable taking values \(1, 2,\ldots\) 
	with known probabilities \(p_1, p_2, \ldots,\) where \(\sum p_i=1\).
	Having observed \(N = n\), perform \(n\) Bernoulli trials with success probability
	\(\theta\), getting \(X\) successes.
	\begin{parts}
		\part
		Prove that the pair (X, N) is minimal sufficient and N is ancillary for Î¸. (Note
		the similarity to some of the hierarchical models discussed in Section 4.4.)
		\part
		Prove that the estimator \(X/N\) is unbiased for \(\theta\) 
		and has variance \(\theta(1-\theta)E(1/N)\).
