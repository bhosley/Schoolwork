\subsection*{Project Title:}
Business Analytics Using Forecasting

\subsection*{Author(s):}
 Maxim Castaneda, Riku Li, Uniss Tseng, and William Feng

\subsection*{The Problem the Author(s) is Trying to Solve in the Project:}
The authors seek to generate a model that will allow Nivea to forecast product supply and demand. Ultimately, the goal is to be able to engage changes in the supply-chain early enough to meet future fluctuations in consumer demand 

\subsection*{Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm(s) used:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Linear Regression
	\item Moving Average
	\item \textbf{ARIMA}
	\item Statistical Ensemble
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{A Brief Description of One of the ML Algorithms used:}
Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (\textbf{ARIMA}) is a technique for making time series predictions. It provides a confidence interval for the next unit of time.
The predictions are made using a moving average based on residuals and assumes that residuals will tend to a normal distribution. \\
ARIMA models can be generated with varies types of intervals and generally work better when other factors can distinguish different time epoch (for example: seasons in a year.) 

\subsection*{Metrics Used to Evaluate the ML Algorithms:}
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
