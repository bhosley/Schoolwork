\subsection*{The Problem the Author(s) is Trying to Solve in the Project:}
[** A brief description goes here **]

\subsection*{Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm(s) used:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ML Algorithm 1 (just the name of the algorithm; such as, Random Forest)
	\item ML Algorithm 2
	\item More $\cdots$
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{A Brief Description of One of the ML Algorithms used:}
[** Pick one of the ML algorithms you wrote down from above and write a brief description on it **] \\
At the beginning, I would suggest that you pick the ML algorithm that you are not familiar with (e.g., Random Forest). Google it. Then write a *short* paragraph on it. \\
• You will find, for most common ML algorithms, there are lots of short YouTube videos on them. Watch them! \\
• As time goes by, you will eventually know most of the ML algorithms (or, at least, heard of most of them). Then you can think of writing a slightly in-depth description. 

\subsection*{Metrics Used to Evaluate the ML Algorithms:}
[** They goes here; e.g., Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for Regression **]
