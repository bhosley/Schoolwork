\section{Introduction to Statistical Learning \\ Chapter 6.8 : Problem 11}
\emph{We will now try to predict per capita crime rate in the
	\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Boston}} data set.}

Prepare the data set:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=bg]{r}
library(MASS)
attach(Boston)
\end{minted}

\subsection{(a)} 
\emph{Try out some of the regression methods explored in this chapter,
	such as best subset selection, the lasso, ridge regression, and
	PCR. Present and discuss results for the approaches that you
	consider.}

\subsection{(b)} 
\emph{Propose a model (or set of models) that seem to perform well on
	this data set, and justify your answer. Make sure that you are
	evaluating model performance using validation set error, cross-validation, or some other reasonable alternative, as opposed to
	using training error.}

\subsection{(c)} 
\emph{Does your chosen model involve all of the features in the data
	set? Why or why not?}
