  abstract        = {Android malware detection has attracted much attention in recent years. Existing methods mainly research on extracting static or dynamic features from mobile apps and build mobile malware detection model by machine learning algorithms. The number of extracted static or dynamic features maybe much high. As a result, the data suffers from high dimensionality. In addition, to avoid being detected, malware data is varied and hard to obtain in the first place. To detect zeroday malware, unsupervised malware detection methods were applied. In such case, unsupervised feature reduction method is an available choice to reduce the data dimensionality. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature learning algorithm called Subspace based Restricted Boltzmann Machines (SRBM) for reducing data dimensionality in malware detection. Multiple subspaces in the original data are firstly searched. And then, an RBM is built on each subspace. All outputs of the hidden layers of the trained RBMs are combined to represent the data in lower dimension. The experimental results on OmniDroid, CIC2019 and CIC2020 datasets show that the features learned by SRBM perform better than the ones learned by other feature reduction methods when the performance is evaluated by clustering evaluation metrics, i.e., NMI, ACC and Fscore.}

  abstract        = {Cybersecurity has become a major concern for society, mainly motivated by the increasing number of cyber attacks and the wide range of targeted objectives. Due to the popularity of smartphones and tablets, Android devices are considered an entry point in many attack vectors. Malware applications are among the most used tactics and tools to perpetrate a cyber attack, so it is critical to study new ways of detecting them. In these detection mechanisms, machine learning has been used to build classifiers that are effective in discerning if an application is malware or benignware. However, training such classifiers require big amounts of labelled data which, in this context, consist of categorised malware and benignware Android applications represented by a set of features able to describe their behaviour. For that purpose, in this paper we present OmniDroid, a large and comprehensive dataset of features extracted from 22,000 real malware and goodware samples, aiming to help anti-malware tools creators and researchers when improving, or developing, new mechanisms and tools for Android malware detection. Furthermore, the characteristics of the dataset make it suitable to be used as a benchmark dataset to test classification and clustering algorithms or new representation techniques, among others. The dataset has been released under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License and was built using AndroPyTool, our automated framework for dynamic and static analysis of Android applications. Finally, we test a set of ensemble classifiers over this dataset and propose a malware detection approach based on the fusion of static and dynamic features through the combination of ensemble classifiers. The experimental results show the feasibility and potential usability (for the machine learning, soft computing and cyber security communities) of our automated framework and the publicly available dataset.}

  abstract        = { The unrivaled threat of android malware is the root cause of various security problems on the internet. Although there are remarkable efforts in detection and classification of android malware based on machine learning techniques, a small number of attempts are made to classify and characterize it using deep learning. Detecting android malware in smartphones is an essential target for cyber community to get rid of menacing malware samples. This paper proposes an image-based deep neural network method to classify and characterize android malware samples taken from a huge malware dataset with 12 prominent malware categories and 191 eminent malware families. This work successfully demonstrates the use of deep image learning to classify and characterize android malware with an accuracy of 93.36% and log loss of less than 0.20 for training and testing set.},
