\subsection*{Q1: Write a SAS program to produce Mean, Minimum, Maximum, Standard Deviation, Skewness, and Kurtosis of the teaching efficiency for each classification.}

\subsection*{Q2: Write a SAS program to produce a table which contains the mean and standard of the teaching efficiency and the value of test statistic and P-value for testing hypotheses that the mean of teaching efficiency is significant different from 14 for each major.}

\subsection*{Q3: Write a SAS program to produce a test of Normality and a plot of Normal probability plot for IQ.}

\subsection*{Q4: Write a SAS program to produce correlation coefficient for Math Score of SAT, IQ, Score of Pilot exam, and Score of Final exam with Teaching efficiency.}

\subsection*{Q5: Write a SAS program to produce  a 95\% confidence interval for the mean of teaching efficiency for each major.}
