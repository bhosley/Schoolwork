\section{Summary} 

Wing \cite{Wing2020} writes about 10 areas of study for the future of data science.
Wing prefaces this list with a question regarding the definition of academic disciplines,
they characterize this definition with examples of the largest questions facing well established, traditional disciplines.
Wing does not provide a singular root question for the field of data science but instead uses the proposal of 10 areas as a potential foundation.
Additionally, several questions concerning the relation between data science and it related disciplines of computer science, mathematics, and statistics.

\section{Analysis}

Wing's assessment of ten areas of interest within the field of data science is backed by several modern papers that are cited within their own paper, though they could easily have included many more on the same topics.
The ten proposed areas are a strong basis for inquiry in the field, though, to call them an enumeration may be a bit bold.
