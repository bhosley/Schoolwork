\section{Summary} 

Wing \cite{Wing2020} writes about 10 areas of study for the future of data science.


\section{Analysis}

Wing's assessment of ten areas of interest within the field of data science is backed by several modern papers that are cited within their own paper, though they could easily have included many more on the same topics.
