\section{Summary} 

Sculley et al.\cite{Sculley2015} write about a common software life-cycle problem call technical debt, specifically as it applies to software utilizing machine learning. 
The research team make the argument that this type of software is especially vulnerable to the added costs of technical debt due to a number of reasons, including costs associated with increasingly complex models.
When software is improved over its lifetime a lot of vestigial code may remain, and for the 'black box' of most machine learning models this vestigial code is even more difficult to manage.


\section{Analysis}

The arguments presented by the research team are well structured and convincing.
