\section{Introduction}

Shooting sports are a type inextricably linked to technology, 
both in terms of the equipment used by the athletes and tools used in their training.
There is substantial interest in maintaining the cutting edge on both fronts as athletes and teams work to remain on top of their competition.
Access to this type of technology comes with a substantial price, which may be suitable to professional athletes or clubs and individuals of greater means.


In this paper we propose to develop an open source training option that accomplished the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identify the point of aim in real-time.
	\item Record the point of aim over the period of an entire shot cycle.
	\item Report this information in an intuitive manner, that may be interpreted by the athlete and to allow for immediate feedback.
	
	\item Record the shot position and to provide the score and direction.
	\item Identify the bull's-eye as a frame of reference for the above functions.
\end{enumerate}

%%%		Open Source Options

First we examine work that similarly looks to address the problem of high cost associated with competitive equipment.
At the time of this writing the available open-source options all address the problem of shot scoring.
Traditionally, target scoring is performed using Piezo-electronic sensor to achieve acoustic triangulation \cite{Anderson2018}.
However, some manufacturers have had success with laser triangulation \cite{SUIS}.
In response to the price of this equipment some developers have produced open source projects featuring acoustic scoring \cite{etarg} \cite{freetarget}.
Still more researchers have sought to use computer vision to perform the scoring \cite{Rudzinski2012} \cite{Stenhager2021}.

Accurate scoring with computer vision and commonly available parts continues to progress rapidly in recent years.
\cite{Ye2011} reliably produced  hit-miss results while \cite{Rudzinski2012} were able to produce competition level accuracy in scoring static targets with the trade-off of extremely controlled reading conditions.
More recently \cite{Stenhager2021} was able to achieve a fairly robust model that could perform in a realistic setting and gave results usable at an amateur level; their scoring unable to accurately score a round at the necessary resolution.

\section{Computer Vision Project 2}

The research and open source projects referenced in the previous section seek to solve the problem of a lack of affordability in commercial solutions to shot scoring and recording.
Generally, the use cases described are for shooting clubs or individual practitioners without the means to acquire professional grade equipment, not the type of club or organization sizable enough to host a tournament.
As such it seems that the underlying motivation is to make opportunities for higher quality training more attainable for all people.
Shot scoring is only one aspect of training and dry-fire training is often \cite{Potter2017}
considered to be a more important for developing a effective results.

As with shot scoring solutions, commercial options for dry-fire training can be expensive, or very limited in scope.
The second project proposal will be to use computer vision, a standard USB camera, and a laser to emulate point of aim feedback available in more expensive 
\cite{scatt} commercial products.
