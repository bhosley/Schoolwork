Problem description
	Paraphrase project description,
	formulate analysis questions of interest to leadership
	
DTMC model formulation (Lesson2 slide 18 (with single entity transition diagram))

Baseline analysis - primary analysis questions
	How often will the squadron be able to achieve mission success, meeting 8-orbit mission requirements
	How long will it take for the squadron become FMC >= 8 aircraft
	What is the long-term sortie generation rate?
	What is the long-term mission capable aircraft availability rate?

Sensitivity (excursion) analyses - the what-if questions, 
	explore possible solutions by modifying parameter values
	
Conclusions and recommendations
