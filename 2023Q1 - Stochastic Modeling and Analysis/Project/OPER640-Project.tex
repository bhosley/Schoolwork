\section{Description}

% Problem description
% 	Paraphrase project description,
% 	formulate analysis questions of interest to leadership

The current situation:



Purpose of this report:

The purpose of this report is to provide information regarding the
expected numbers of fully mission capable aircraft 
available for sortie generation, in order to assist
decision makers to make and take more informed courses of action.

Initial inquiries:

First, we will examine the expected time it will take from the 
current situation for the squadron to return to sortie generating capable.
Second, we will examine the expected long term availability of aircraft
if the current operational conditions persist.
Finally, we will examine the effects of changes to current operations, 
to provide the information necessary to evaluate which of those changes 
will have the greatest return on investment.


\section{Modeling the Situation}

%DTMC model formulation (Lesson2 slide 18 (with single entity transition diagram))

% Define Xn as the state of the system at time n or the n-th observation (or event)
% Define the state space S as the set of all possible outcomes for Xn
% Verify the Markov Property is satisfied.
% Verify Time-Homogeneity
% Construct the Transition Probability Matrix. Or specify probability function p_ij.
% As needed:
% 	Formulate state transition function (X_n+1 as a function of X_n)
% 	Draw a Transition Diagram.
% 	Define a cost or reward function.

Figure \ref{DTMC} shows the state-cycle of an individual aircraft.

\section{Baseline Analysis}

% Baseline analysis - primary analysis questions
% 	How often will the squadron be able to achieve mission success, meeting 8-orbit mission requirements
% 	How long will it take for the squadron become FMC >= 8 aircraft
% 	What is the long-term sortie generation rate?
% 	What is the long-term mission capable aircraft availability rate?

\section{Exploratory Analysis}

% Sensitivity (excursion) analyses - the what-if questions, 
% 	explore possible solutions by modifying parameter values

\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}

% Conclusions and recommendations
