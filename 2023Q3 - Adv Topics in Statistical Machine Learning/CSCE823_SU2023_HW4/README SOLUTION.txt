It is recommended that you review but not run the student solution....
It will take a while to run, even though set on a lower number of training epochs than the student's original longer trained submission.
Note that the student solution provided will produce over 1.5GB of intermediate files to speed up processing of the text information - so if you do run the code, make sure you have at least 2-3GB of free disk space.
