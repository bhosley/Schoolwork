\subsection{Data Imbalance}

\subsubsection{Overview}
There are many potential issues associated with data that has significant imbalance between classes. 
While the data-level techniques were addressed in the previous course, 
this time we will examine algorithmic-level techniques.

\subsubsection{Relevance}
It is highly probable that students will encounter data imbalance of various sizes,
a survey of different approaches will hopefully point other students in useful directions
for their theses, or in future projects.

\subsubsection{Rationale}
This topic is a continuation of my previous and probably future class project.
While I do not expect that my dissertation with be very focused on imbalance, 
I do expect that the same statistical principles that make imbalance a problem
will similarly be an obstacle within the areas of interest.

\subsubsection{Activities}
The coding exercise will likely be comprised of a skeleton code in the style of what 
is normally presented in this course.
The student code may be a segment of implementing and adjusting the parameters 
of threshold moving, cost-sensitive learning, and novel loss functions that address this problem.
