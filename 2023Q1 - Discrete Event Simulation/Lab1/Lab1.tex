%	\begin{ Question 1}	  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question 
Record the mean queue length for inspection and its 95\% confidence interval half-width. \\
\hspace{3em} \textit{Half-widths can be found in the Pivot Grid or SMORE plot.}

	S
\end{solution}

%	\begin{ Question 2}	  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question

%	\begin{ Question 3}	  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question 
For each measure of interest, is it time-weighted or observational?
\begin{solution}
	S
\end{solution}

%	\begin{ Question 4}	  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question 
Come up with two additional assumptions that don’t disrupt the model you have built.

%	\begin{ Question 5}	  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question

	S
\end{solution}
%\end{ Question 5}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	\begin{ Question 6}	  %
