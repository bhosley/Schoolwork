		all on the same ﬁgure, each distribution having mean zero,
		 but let the standard deviations be 1/4, 1/2, 1, and 2.}

	\textit{Records pertaining to the monthly number of job-related injuries 
		at an underground coal mine were being studied by a federal agency. 
		The values for the past 100 months were as follows:}
	\begin{tabular}{cc}
		\toprule
		\textit{Injuries per Month} & \textit{Frequency of Occurrence} \\
		\midrule
		0 & 35 \\
		1 & 40 \\
		2 & 13 \\
		3 & 6 \\
		4 & 4 \\
		5 & 1 \\
		6 & 1 \\

	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Apply the chi-square test to these data to test the hypothesis that the underlying distribution is Poisson. Use the level of signiﬁcance α = 0.05.
		\item Apply the chi-square test to these data to test the hypothesis that the distribution is Poisson with mean 1.0. Again let α = 0.05.
		\item What are the differences between parts (a) and (b), and when might each case arise?
