In these urban areas residents with different racial or socioeconomic background tend to form homogeneous clusters. Schelling’s famous agent-based model for residential segregation explains how such clusters can form even if all agents are tolerant, i.e., if they agree to live in mixed neighborhoods. For segregation to occur, all it needs is a slight bias towards agents preferring similar neighbors. Very recently, Schelling’s model has been investigated from a game-theoretic point of view with selfish agents that strategically select their residential location. In these games, agents can improve on their current location by performing a location swap with another agent who is willing to swap. We significantly deepen these investigations by studying the influence of the underlying topology modeling the residential area on the existence of equilibria, the Price of Anarchy and on the dynamic properties of the resulting strategic multi-agent system. Moreover, as a new conceptual contribution, we also consider the influence of locality, i.e., if the location swaps are restricted to swaps of neighboring agents. We give improved almost tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy for arbitrary underlying graphs and we present (almost) tight bounds for regular graphs, paths and cycles. Moreover, we give almost tight bounds for grids, which are commonly used in empirical studies. For grids we also show that locality has a severe impact on the game dynamics.}, number={2}, journal={Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems}, author={Bilò, Davide and Bilò, Vittorio and Lenzner, Pascal and Molitor, Louise}, year={2022}, month={Aug}, pages={47}, language={en} }

Inspired by a recent stream of work, we study welfare guarantees and complexity in this model with respect to several welfare measures. First, we show that while maximizing the social welfare is NP-hard, computing an assignment of agents to the nodes of any topology graph with approximately half of the maximum welfare can be done in polynomial time. We then consider Pareto optimality, introduce two new optimality notions based on it, and establish mostly tight bounds on the worst-case welfare loss for assignments satisfying these notions as well as the complexity of computing such assignments. In addition, we show that for tree topologies, it is possible to decide whether there exists an assignment that gives every agent a positive utility in polynomial time; moreover, when every node in the topology has degree at least 2, such an assignment always exists and can be found efficiently.}, journal={Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research}, author={Bullinger, Martin and Suksompong, Warut and Voudouris, Alexandros A.}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={143–174}, language={en} }

In our model, the agents are partitioned into k types and need to select locations on an undirected graph. Agents can be either stubborn, in which case they will always choose their preferred location, or strategic, in which case they aim to maximize the fraction of agents of their own type in their neighborhood. We investigate the existence of equilibria in these games, study the complexity of finding an equilibrium outcome or an outcome with high social welfare, and also provide upper and lower bounds on the price of anarchy and stability. Some of our results extend to the setting where the preferences of the agents over their neighbors are defined by a social network rather than a partition into types.}, note={arXiv:1902.07937 [cs]}, journal={Artificial Intelligence}, author={Elkind, Edith and Gan, Jiarui and Igarashi, Ayumi and Suksompong, Warut and Voudouris, Alexandros A.}, year={2021}, month={Dec}, pages={103576} }

Agents belong to two groups: they remove and add relationships when more than half of their neighbors are from the other group. We find that the original segregation gap between the intolerance threshold and the resulting segregation level is maintained in a network setting. When comparing different agents strategies, we find that random behaviors actually lead to more segregated networks than discriminating behaviors, due to the fact that randomness provokes cascades of dissatisfaction. The initial network topology does not seem to affect the results.}, booktitle={2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM)}, author={Gretha, Olivier Brandouy and Cristal, Philippe Mathieu and Mauhe, Nicolas}, year={2018}, month={Aug}, pages={95–98} }

We consider natural generalizations that allow for the possibility of agents being tolerant towards other agents, even if they are not of the same type. In particular, we consider an ordering of the types, and make the realistic assumption that the agents are in principle more tolerant towards agents of types that are closer to their own according to the ordering. Based on this, we study the strategic games induced when the agents aim to maximize their utility, for a variety of tolerance levels.

Two ways of modeling agent movement here are either to allow two agents to swap their vertices or to allow an agent to jump to a free vertex. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we prove that deciding the existence of a swap-equilibrium and a jump-equilibrium in this simplest model of Schelling games is NP-hard, thereby answering questions left open by Agarwal et al. [AAAI ’20] and Elkind et al. [IJCAI ’19]. Second, we introduce two measures for the robustness of equilibria in Schelling games in terms of the minimum number of edges or the minimum number of vertices that need to be deleted to make an equilibrium unstable. We prove tight lower and upper bounds on the edge- and vertex-robustness of swap-equilibria in Schelling games on different graph classes.}, note={arXiv:2105.06561 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2105.06561}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Kreisel, Luca and Boehmer, Niclas and Froese, Vincent and Niedermeier, Rolf}, year={2022}, month={Mar} }

A major implication of the model is that individual preferences of similarity lead to a collective segregation behavior. Schelling used Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with uni-dimensional agents. In reality, people are multidimensional. This raises the question of whether multi-dimensionality can boost stability or reduce segregation in society. In this paper, we first adopt ABM to reconstruct Schelling’s original model and discuss its convergence behaviors under different threshold levels. Then, we extend Schelling’s model with multidimensional agents and investigate convergence behaviors of the model. Results suggest that if agents have high levels of demand for identical neighbors, the society might become less stable or even chaotic. Also, several experiments suggest that multidimensional agents are able to form a stable society that is not segregated, if agents prefer to stay adjacent to not only “identical” but also “similar” neighbors.}, booktitle={2019 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)}, author={Liu, Zeyu and Li, Xueping and Khojandi, Anahita and Lazarova-Molnar, Sanja}, year={2019}, month={Dec}, pages={285–296} }

This is an abstract study of the interactive dynamics of discriminatory individual choices. One model is a simulation in which individual members of two recognizable groups distribute themselves in neighborhoods defined by reference to their own locations. A second model is analytic and deals with compartmented space. A final section applies the analytics to ‘neighborhood tipping.’ The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results. Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated. A general theory of ‘tipping’ begins to emerge.}, number={2}, journal={The Journal of Mathematical Sociology}, publisher={Routledge}, author={Schelling, Thomas C.}, year={1971}, month={Jul}, pages={143–186} }
