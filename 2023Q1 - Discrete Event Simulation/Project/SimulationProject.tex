\section{Introduction}

In 1971, while working for the RAND Corporation, Thomas C. Schelling began investigating
the manner in which segregation occurs in the absence of

\section{System Models and Problem Formulation}
\subsection{Optimization}

Original model was too slow, clocking an average of 18.1 seconds.

replacing indexed iterations with enumerations and 
removing redundant addition in the check happy routine shaved this to 6.8

Removing gridsize+1 had no improvement, likely that the interpreter handled that.

Changed the way that new zones are selected for movement of unhappy agents got to 5.8 seconds
discovered that new agents moved randomly to zones empty in the first grid, but there was no accounting
of where agents moved this time, as such multiple agents could move to the same zone

removed random int just before figure (purpose uknown possibly to advance the rng, but only once...)
removed the accounting on the old grid for moving agents


did the same for placing agents, shortened to 3.8 sec
