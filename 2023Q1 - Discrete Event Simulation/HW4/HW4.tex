\subsection{}
System data for the job shop of Exercise 1 revealed that the average time spent by a job in the
shop was approximately 4 working days. The model made the following predictions, on seven
independent replications, for average time spent in the shop:
\[3.70\quad 4.21\quad 4.35\quad 4.13\quad 3.83\quad 4.32\quad 4.05\]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Is model output consistent with system behavior? Conduct a statistical test, using the level of
	significance \(\alpha = 0.01\).
	\item If it is important to detect a difference of \(0.5\) day, what sample size is needed to have a power
	of \(0.90\)? Interpret your results in terms of model validity or invalidity. (Use \(\alpha = 0.01\).)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution:}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item 
	Comparing \(t_0\) to \(t\) first we calculate
	\[t_0 = \frac{\bar X - \mu_0}{S/\sqrt n} = \frac{4.0843-4}{0.24412/\sqrt{7}} = \frac{0.0843}{0.0923} = 0.9133.\]
	Next we look up the \(t\) value,
	\[t_{0.005,6} = 3.707.\]
	Since \(t_0 < t\) we fail to reject the hypothesis and 
	conclude that this model output is consistent with the observed system behavior. \\
	
	\item 
	First we calculate the \(\hat\delta\) from the desired sensitivity of \(0.5\) 
	days and the standard deviation used in part (a),
	
	\[\hat\delta = \frac{0.5}{0.24412} = 2.0482.\] 
	
	Then, we consult the A.10 table with the values of \(\alpha=0.01\) and \(\beta=0.10\) 
	to determine that the sample should be approximately \(n=8\).
