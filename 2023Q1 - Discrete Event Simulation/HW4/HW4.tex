\subsection{}
System data for the job shop of Exercise 1 revealed that the average time spent by a job in the
shop was approximately 4 working days. The model made the following predictions, on seven
independent replications, for average time spent in the shop:
\[3.70\quad 4.21\quad 4.35\quad 4.13\quad 3.83\quad 4.32\quad 4.05\]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Is model output consistent with system behavior? Conduct a statistical test, using the level of
	significance \(\alpha = 0.01\).
	\item If it is important to detect a difference of \(0.5\) day, what sample size is needed to have a power
	of \(0.90\)? Interpret your results in terms of model validity or invalidity. (Use \(\alpha = 0.01\).)
\end{enumerate}
