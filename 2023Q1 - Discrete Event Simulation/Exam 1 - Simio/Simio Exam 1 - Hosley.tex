\question 
(40\%) Working Simio model file saved with experiment results. \\
- There is not only one correct model for this problem. 
You have room for creativity while still accurately modeling the described system.

\question 
Typed summary report (no more than 4 pages) containing:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[2a.] (30\%) Conceptual modeling description:
	\begin{solution}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[2ai.] Entities/Components
				Entities needed:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Workers: Crew Chief, Maintenance Crew, Service Crew 
					\item Model Entities: Jet, Flight (Parent Object for 4 fighters)
					\item Resources: Runway
				\end{enumerate}
				Components needed:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Servers: Mission Prep, Preflight, Takeoff, Sortie, Landing, Servicing, Unscheduled Maintenance
					\item Combiner: To form flight of 4
					\item Separator: To dissolve the flight
				\end{enumerate}
			\item[2aii.] Assumptions
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Travel time is either included in activity distributions or ignored
					\item Workers travel instantaneously
					\item We do not care about pilots.
					\item Any breaks are accounted for within the times of the other tasks
					\item Supplies, tools, fuel, etc. are always readily available in necessary amounts
					\item 10 minutes covers the take-off of all 4 jets, with no variation
					\item Same for landing
				\end{enumerate}
			\item[2aiii.] Inputs required \\
				The inputs 
				
			\item[2aiv.] Measures of performance \\
				
			\item[2av.] Experimental controls required \\
				Whether or not the maintenance crew can do service crew work 
				and how many service crews are available.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{solution}
	\item[2b.] (10\%) Results table summarizing response variables requested
	\begin{solution}
		S
	\end{solution}
	\item[2c.] (20\%) Analysis of scenarios
	\begin{solution}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[2ci.] Individual scenario analysis (what do the numbers mean?)\\
		\item[2cii.] Comparative analysis of scenarios using SMORE plots of response variables.\\
		\item[2ciii.] Recommendations based on statistical and practical differences between scenario responses. \\
