\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{The Case for Input-Invariant Architectures}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Heterogeneous agent teams frequently encounter differences in observation 
            structure due to varying sensor suites and mission roles.
        \item Traditional policy networks require fixed, consistent inputsâ€”limiting their 
            ability to scale or adapt.
        \item Input-invariant architectures offer a promising alternative by allowing 
            policies to generalize across agents and configurations without retraining.
        \item This contribution explores how these architectures can improve learning 
            efficiency and robustness in dynamic, real-world team settings.

        \item[RQ 1] {
            How does incorporating input-invariant structures \emph{(i.e., networks 
            that are robust to feature permutation and input length differences)}
            into policy networks affect learning efficiency and team robustness 
            when heterogeneous agents have partially overlapping observations?
            }

            Do input-invariant architectures lead to more stable policy performance under 
            team-size changes and partial observation loss during execution?
