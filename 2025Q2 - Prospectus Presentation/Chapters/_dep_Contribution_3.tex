\begin{frame}{The Case for Progressive Network Growth}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In reinforcement learning, larger networks often yield better performanceâ€”but 
            training large models from scratch can be inefficient and unstable.
        \item Many real-world systems require policies to grow over time in response to 
            increasing task complexity or mission demands.
        \item Projection-based methods offer a way to expand policy networks mid-training 
            without discarding previously learned behavior.
        \item This contribution investigates the feasibility and benefits of progressive 
            architectural growth as an efficient training strategy.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[RQ 1] {
            Can tensor-based projections be used to grow a policy network's capacity during 
            training while preserving the functional behavior of the original network?}
        \item[RQ 2] {
            Can we identify appropriate transition points during training when projecting 
            to a larger policy network yields the greatest benefit?}
        \item[RQ 3] {
            Does this progressive architectural growth strategy reduce total training cost 
            or improve final policy performance compared to fixed-size architectures?}
