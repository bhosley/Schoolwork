# Outline of Empirical Modeling Project

## Introduction Section

The purpose of this report is to demonstrate proficiency in the course material by 
modeling NFL player performance to achieve utilizing the first pick in the most optimal way (probabilistic)

The league has ten fantasy teams, and I have the number one pick; and thus the 20 as well.
As such predicting top 20 players ensures that we can select at least two of those players.

Prioritizing consistency in performance. We will use average points per game as our metric.
Regress data from the 2020 and 2021 (can use 2019 as well), target is to predict 2022 performance.

```{r, include=FALSE}
df19 <- read_excel('./ProjectData.xlsx', sheet = '2019 Regular Season')
df20 <- read_excel('./ProjectData.xlsx', sheet = '2020 Regular Season')
df21 <- read_excel('./ProjectData.xlsx', sheet = '2021 Regular Season')
df22 <- read_excel('./ProjectData.xlsx', sheet = '2022 Regular Season')
```

# Support functions:
#   Correlate Rosters



>## Material to be assessed includes:
>Data organization, aggregation, and cleaning

```{r}
df2019.gathered <- scale(subset(df19, select= c(-Name, -Team, -Position, -Total))) %>%
  as_data_frame() %>%
  mutate( Position = as.factor(df19$Position) ) %>%
  gather(key = "variable", value = "value",
         -PPG, -Position )

#df2019.gathered['Position'] <- df19$Position
head(df2019.gathered, 3)

featurePlot <- ggplot(df2019.gathered, aes(x = value, y = PPG)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Position)) +
  facet_wrap(~variable, ncol = 2) + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)

ggsave(featurePlot, "./feature_comparison.png", dpi=300, width = 12)
```

One of the major difficulties will be making legitimate comparisons given the different positions that play are likely to earn points via different means.


 
> Variable selection and model creation/comparison

# Utilize Dredge and/or model subset selection


> Adequacy checking, transformation (if necessary), and analysis of influential observations

> Analysis and interpretation of results

> Written communication in a technical report


3. Methodology
Step 1. Use 2021 fantasy points per game for each player as the dependent (response) variable.
Step 2. Build a regression model using 2020 fantasy football data as the independent variable
set to predict the 2020 fantasy points per game.
• Students determine which variables are useful (which to include in model)
• Students are free to obtain additional, open-source data to supplement the feature set if so desired
• Torture the data until it confesses. . . but don’t torture it so much that it will confess to anything!
Step 3. Once the final model is built, apply it to 2021 data to predict the average points per
game for the 2022 season.
• Rank the players by predicted fantasy points per game in descending order.
• Make your prediction for which two players you would draft.
Step 4. Present your results in writing.
Following the AFIT Style Guide, write a double-spaced technical report not longer than eight (8) pages
in length for the body of the report. The report should include a 2-5 sentence abstract and sections that
respectively:
(a) Introduce and motivate the project.
(b) Discuss the methodology, to include variable selection, adequacy checking, model validation, and analysis of influential observations.
(c) Present the model, results, and analysis.
(d) Discuss the results, and provide insights and recommendations.
Within your report, include at least one relevant table and at least one relevant figure. Recall that table
titles go above the table and figure titles go below the figure.
The cover page, table of contents, abstract, references, appendices, and other material do not count
against the eight-page limit.
