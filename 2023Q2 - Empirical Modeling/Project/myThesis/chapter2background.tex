In the literature, several studies have employed methods similar to linear techniques to predict player performance in fantasy football. For instance, 
Lutz \cite{lutz2015}
used a support vector model to predict the number of points a player would score in a season based on their performance in the previous season. Similarly, 
Baughman et al.  \cite{baughman2021}
developed a multiple linear regression model (in addition to a number of other, more cutting edge machine learning algorithms) that incorporated additional variables such as player age, team strength, and injury history.

However, these studies have often found that even more complex and flexible methods still struggle to account for the inherent variability and uncertainty in sports performance. This is due to complex interactions between numerous factors influencing player performance, many of which are difficult to quantify or predict.
