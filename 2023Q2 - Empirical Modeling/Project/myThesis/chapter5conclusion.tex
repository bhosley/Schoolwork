In a scenario where we do in fact end up with the first and twentieth picks, our model would select Derrick Henry and Tyreek Hill, respectively. While Derrick Henry's performance fell short of expectations, Tyreek Hill exceeded them significantly.

Figure \ref{fig:ranksplot} shows our model's predictions vs. actual performance. Provided that the majority of our competitors choose players from the middle section it appears that our picks will perform well. However, confidence in this pattern persisting should be cautioned against, as there is no reason to believe that the next season's erroneous predictions will behave in the same manner.
