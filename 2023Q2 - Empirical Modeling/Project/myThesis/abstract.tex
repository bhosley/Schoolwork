This paper presents an approach to fantasy football team drafting, utilizing historical player performance data to predict future outcomes. The objective is to enhance the decision-making process during the draft phase, a critical component of fantasy football where the foundation of a competitive team is built.
Our methodology incorporates both player-specific and team-wide variables, acknowledging the multifaceted nature of football performance. 
The predictive model is then used to inform a drafting strategy, aiming to maximize the expected performance of the drafted team while considering the risk associated with each player. We introduce a metric for player value that combines predicted performance with risk assessment, providing a robust basis for draft decisions.
The results demonstrate the potential of regression to significantly improve drafting outcomes, leading to more competitive fantasy football teams.
Future work will explore the application of this methodology to financially viable strategies.
