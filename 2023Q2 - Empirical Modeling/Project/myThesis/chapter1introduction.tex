This final project is designed to showcase the understanding and application of the concepts and methodologies taught in the OPER 679 course. The project will employ a variety of techniques, some of which may not be the most optimal for the given scenario. However, these suboptimal techniques are included intentionally to demonstrate their application and potential outcomes. Each technique's usage and context will be thoroughly discussed when they are implemented.

The use of statistical modeling techniques to predict player performance in fantasy football is not a new concept. Various studies have attempted to apply different predictive models to this problem, with varying degrees of success. Linear regression, in particular, has been a popular choice due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in capturing relationships between variables.

This project's objective will be using several datasets sourced from National Football League statistics to inform a hypothetical fantasy football draft, providing a practical and engaging context for demonstrating competency in the course objectives. The final objective is to predict a roster of the top 20 players by points per game; by selecting 20 it is ensured that for any given draft order two options will be available, regardless of the other drafters choices. The measurement used to evaluate players will be the "points per game" (PPG).
