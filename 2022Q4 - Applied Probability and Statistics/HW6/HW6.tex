\question 
Let \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) be a random sample of size \(n\) from an exponential distribution, 
\(X_i\sim\operatorname{Shifted Exponential}(\beta=1,\eta)\). 
A test of \(H_0\ :\,\eta\leq\eta_0\) vs. \(H_a\ :\,\eta>\eta_0\)
is desired, based on \(X_{(1)}\). 
Find a critical region of size \(\alpha\) of the form \(\{x_{(1)}\geq c\}\).

Let \(X_1,\ldots,X_n\) be a random sample from an exponential distribution,
\(X\sim\operatorname{EXP}(\theta)\).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question 
Suppose that 45 workers in a textile mill are selected at random in a study of accident rate. 
The number of accidents per worker is assumed to be Poisson distributed with mean \(\mu\). 
The average number of accidents per worker is \(\bar{x}=1.7\).
Find an approximate one-sided lower 90\% confidence limit for \(\mu\) 
using eq (11.3.20).
\begin{solution}
	Eq. (11.3.20) = \(\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sqrt{\mu/n}}\overset{d}{\rightarrow} Z\sim N(0,1)\); 
	which by theorem 7.7.4 is 
	\(\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sqrt{\bar{X}/n}}\overset{d}{\rightarrow} Z\sim N(0,1)\).
	
	90\% CI $\rightarrow Z = 1.285$ 
	
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{1.7-\mu}{\sqrt{\mu/45}} &\rightarrow 1.285 \\
		\mu &< 1.7-1.285(\sqrt{1.7/45}) \\
		&< 1.7-1.285(\sqrt{0.194}) \\
		&< 1.7-1.285(0.24975) \\
		&< 1.45024

Consider the biased coin discussed in Example 9.2.5, where the probability of a head, 
\(p\), is known to be 0.2, 0.30, or 0.80. 
The coin is tossed repeatedly, 
and we let \(X\) be the number of tosses required to obtain the first head. 
For a test of \(H_0\ :\,p=0.30\), suppose we use a rejection region of the form
\(\{1,14,15,\ldots\}\). Find \(P\left[\text{TI}\right]=\alpha=\)

Compare the MSEs of \(\hat{\theta_1}\) and \(\hat{\theta_2}\) for \(n=2\).
\begin{solution}
	\begin{align*}
		\hat{\theta_1} &= \bar{X} \\
		\hat{\theta_2} & = \frac{n\bar{X}}{(n+1)} 
		= \frac{2}{3}\bar{X} \quad \text{for } n=2 \\
