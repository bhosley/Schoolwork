%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\question 
Suppose an ordinary six-sided die is rolled repeatedly, and the outcome--1,2,3,4,5 or 6--is noted on each roll. What is the probability that the number of rolls until the first 6 occurs is at most 10?
\begin{solution}
	\(P(X\leq10) = 1-(1-1/6)^10 = 1-(5/6)^10 = 1-0.16150558 = 0.83849442\)
\end{solution}

\question 
The time (in minutes) until the third customer of the day enters a store is a random variable \(x \sim \operatorname{GAM}(1,3)\). If the store opens at 8 a.m. find the third customer arrives after 8:10.
\begin{solution}
	\(\alpha=1, \beta=3, x \leq 10\)
	\begin{align*}
	f(x=10) 
	&= 1-\frac{(x=10)^{1-(\alpha=1)}e^{-(x=10)/(\beta=3)}}{(\beta=3)^{(\alpha=1)}\Gamma(\alpha=1)}
	= 1-\frac{(10)^{1-1}e^{-10/3}}{3^{1}\Gamma(1)} \\
	&= 1-\frac{10e^{-10/3}}{3} = 1-0.11891331115 = 0.88108668885
	\end{align*}

\question 
A jar contains 30 green jelly beans and 20 purple jelly beans. Suppose 10 jelly beans are selected at random from the jar. Find the probability of obtaining exactly five purple jelly beans if they are selected without replacement.
\begin{solution}
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\binom{20}{5}\binom{50-20}{10-5}}{\binom{50}{10}}
		&= \frac{\bigg(\frac{20!}{5!\cdot15!}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{30!}{5!\cdot25!}\bigg)}%
				{\bigg(\frac{50!}{10!\cdot40!}\bigg)} \\
		&= \frac{(15504)(142506)}{(10272278170)} \\
		&= 0.215085007184825

\question 
Assume the amount of light $X$ (in lumens) produced by a certain type of light bulb is normally distributed with mean \(\mu=350\) and variance \(\sigma^2=400\). Find the value $c$ such that the amount of light produced by 90\% of the light bulbs will exceed $c$ lumens.
\begin{solution}
	\(P = 0.1 \rightarrow Z = 1.285\) (Source: Z-score table) \\
	\[c = 350 - (\sqrt{450}(1.285)) = 350 - 20(1.285) = 350 - 25.7 = 324.3\]
