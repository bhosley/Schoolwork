	abstract = {Cloud computing services allow users to lease computing resources from large scale data centers operated by service providers. Using cloud services, users can deploy a wide variety of applications dynamically and on-demand. Most cloud service providers use machine virtualization to provide flexible and costeffective resource sharing. However, few studies have investigated the impact of machine virtualization in the cloud on networking performance.In this paper, we present a measurement study to characterize the impact of virtualization on the networking performance of the Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) data center. We measure the processor sharing, packet delay, TCP/UDP throughput and packet loss among Amazon EC2 virtual machines. Our results show that even though the data center network is lightly utilized, virtualization can still cause significant throughput instability and abnormal delay variations. We discuss the implications of our findings on several classes of applications.},

	title = "Understanding the mirai botnet",
	abstract = "The Mirai botnet, composed primarily of embedded and IoT devices, took the Internet by storm in late 2016 when it overwhelmed several high-profile targets with massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we provide a seven-month retrospective analysis of Mirai{\textquoteright}s growth to a peak of 600k infections and a history of its DDoS victims. By combining a variety of measurement perspectives, we analyze how the botnet emerged, what classes of devices were affected, and how Mirai variants evolved and competed for vulnerable hosts. Our measurements serve as a lens into the fragile ecosystem of IoT devices. We argue that Mirai may represent a sea change in the evolutionary development of botnets — the simplicity through which devices were infected and its precipitous growth, demonstrate that novice malicious techniques can compromise enough low-end devices to threaten even some of the best-defended targets. To address this risk, we recommend technical and nontechnical interventions, as well as propose future research directions.",
