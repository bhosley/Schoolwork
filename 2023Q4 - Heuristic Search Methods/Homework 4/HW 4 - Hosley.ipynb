    "3. (2 Pts) Using the criteria found in Lecture 04, critique your heuristic. \n",
    "#### Simplicity\n",
    "- As far as bag-packing heuristics simplicity is perhaps the best feature for this script.\n",
    "#### Reasonable storage requirements\n",
    "- This script, at any given time, stores up to \n",
    "    - 1x Attribute matrices (constraint x item) \n",
    "    - 1x Utility array (1 x items) \n",
    "    - 2x Bag Content array (1 x items) \n",
    "    - 3x (1 x constraints) arrays for Bag constraints, slack, and current inventory costs\n",
    "    - 3x Integers\n",
    "- With proper garbage collection the compute space should not require any more space than what is necessary to store the above items. The first two matrices are constant, the main bag content array is mutated in place, and the candidate list should be unallocated at the end of each loop; the constraints array is also constant; everything else is subject to Python's garbage collection practices, however good or bad that may be.\n",
    "#### Speed\n",
    "- In the example it runs really fast. It should be considered an $O(n\\log n)$ time heuristic,\n",
    "as it might be possible for each item to move through the bag, and each item utilizes a search over\n",
    "each other item, but based on the method used to measure relative values each item may move through the bag only as many times as there are starting items in the bag.\n",
    "#### Accuracy of solution\n",
    "- The solution provided is similar to results provided by the exhaustive search performed in HW 1. However, there are configurations shown in that answer that are better; thus this answer is good but demonstrably sub-optimal.\n",
    "#### Good answers most of the time\n",
    "- Given no initial state it will return a significantly-better-than-random answer. Given an initial feasible answer it will always return an equal or better solution.\n",
    "#### Low variance about these good answers\n",
    "- This implementation is deterministic. Given the same values, the only variables affecting the output are the initial feasible solution and the order in which the items are presented.\n",
    "#### Robustness\n",
    "- This implementation is relatively robust. The most obvious edge case that it will be weak against is one in which it would be beneficial to remove multiple objects already within the bag and replace them with a better, more costly item. It would be possible to add a subroutine within the above implementation that checks subsets of contents against individual items outside of the bag. This would narrow the weakness to cases in which a subset of external objects are an improvement over a subset of bag contents.\n",
    "- This implementation also works without an initial solution and will return an error if the provided initial solution is not feasible. Given more time, I would have liked to take the infeasible solution, remove item(s) until it is feasible, then start the rest of the heuristic."
