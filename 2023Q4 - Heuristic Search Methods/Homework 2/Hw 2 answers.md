In the hospital-resident matching problem the goal is to match medical residents' choices 
for training probgrams with the hospitals hat offer those programs. Simultaneously we seek to match
the hospitals' preferences with their preferred applicants.

The resulting matches are considered to be stable if the following conditions are met:
1. No candidate is unmatched *or*
2. No candidate is matched to a program when a more prefered program has an opening
3. Some program has an open slot *or*
4. A program would prefer some other applicant over the ones assigned to it

The military application of this problem is that it is essentially a perfect similitude
for several problems faced by AFPC.
One may consider that during accessions each cadet/candidate will be assigned an AFSC;
in the process of doing so, a CFM (career field manager) will have a target number of 
personell to meet the needs of the Air Force. For a number of reasons it is desirable
to make these assignments with respect to the cadet/candidate's desired field.
Ideally this will be a stable match.

Another iteration of this problem occurs during movement cycles where vulnerable movers are
assigned to open billets. The movers have an opportunity to provide an ordered list of their preferences, and the hiring billet owner can likewise provide a ranked list of preferred candidates.
Once again, it is preferable to maximize the utility of all involved parties.

In the case that stability does not exist what might we do?

There are game theoretic answers, where we may wish to maximize overall happiness,
or minimize the maximum unhappiness.
