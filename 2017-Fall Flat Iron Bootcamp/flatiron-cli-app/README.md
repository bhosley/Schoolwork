Project for Flatirons school CLI gem project.

The application is an incredibly light and simple CLI application and web scraper. I am not terribly impressed by my work here, and don't expect you to be either. I am just hoping to demonstrate some level of understanding of several basic competencies.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gem_bundle'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gem_bundle

## Usage

Follow the isntructions

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
