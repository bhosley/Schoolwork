\begin{questions}

	\question In each of the following, find the pdf of $Y$. Show that the pdf integrates to 1.
	\begin{parts}
		\part $Y=X^3$ and $f_X(x) = 42 x^5 (1-x), \ 0 < x < 1$
		\part $Y= 4X + 3$ and $f_X(x) = 7e^{-7x}, \ 0 < x <\infty$
		\part $Y=X^2$ and $f_X(x) = 30 x^2 (1-x)^2, \ 0 < x < 1$
	\end{parts}
	(See Example A.0.2 in Appendix A.)
	
	\begin{solution}\\
		(a)
		The PDF is
		\begin{align*}
			f_Y(y) &= f_X(g^{-1}(y)) \left|\frac{d}{dy}g^{-1}(y) \right| \\
			&= f_X(y^{1/3}) \left|\frac{d}{dy}y^{1/3} \right| \\
			&=  42y^{5/3} \left(1-y^{1/3}\right)  \left|\frac{1}{3}y^{-2/3} \right| \\
			&=  14y\left(1-y^{1/3}\right). \\
		\end{align*}
		The range is the same, shown by $ 0^{3} < y < 1^{3} = 0 < y < 1$. \\
		Integration is equal to 1:
		\begin{align*}
			\int_{0}^{1}f_Y(y) \,dy
			&= \int_{0}^{1} 14y-14y^{4/3} \,dy \\
			&= \left. 7y^2-6y^{7/3} \right|_0^1 \\
			&= (7-6) - (0-0) = 1.
		\end{align*}
		 
		
		(b)
		The PDF is
		\begin{align*}
			f_Y(y) &= f_X(g^{-1}(y)) \left|\frac{d}{dy}g^{-1}(y) \right| \\
			&= f_X( \frac{y-3}{4} ) \left|\frac{d}{dy}\,\frac{y-3}{4}  \right| \\
			&= \frac{7}{4}e^{-\frac{7}{4}(y-3)}
		\end{align*}
		The range is $ \left[4(0)+3\right] < y < \left[4(\infty)+3\right] = 3 < y < \infty$. \\
		Integration is equal to 1:
		\begin{align*}
			\int_{3}^{\infty}f_Y(y) \,dy
			&= \int_{3}^{\infty} \frac{7}{4}e^{-\frac{7}{4}(y-3)} \,dy \\
			&= \left. -e^{-\frac{7}{4}(y-3)} \right|_3^\infty \\
			&= (-e^{-\infty}) - (-e^0)
			= 0 + 1 = 1.
		\end{align*}
		
		(c)
		The PDF is
		\begin{align*}
			f_Y(y) &= f_X(g^{-1}(y)) \left|\frac{d}{dy}g^{-1}(y) \right| \\
			&= f_X( y^{1/2} ) \left|\frac{d}{dy} y^{1/2} \right| \\
			&=  30(y^{1/2})^2(1-y^{1/2})^2  \left|\frac{1}{2} y^{-1/2} \right| \\
			&= \frac{ 30y(1-2y^{1/2} + y) }{2y^{1/2}} \\
			&= 15y^{1/2}(1-2y^{1/2} + y) \\
			&= 15(y^{1/2}-2y + y^{3/2})
		\end{align*}
		The range is the same, shown by $ 0^{2} < y < 1^{2} = 0 < y < 1$. \\
		Integration is equal to 1:
		\begin{align*}
			\int_{0}^{1}f_Y(y) \,dy
			&= \int_{0}^{1} 15(y^{1/2}-2y + y^{3/2}) \,dy \\
			&= \left. 10y^{3/2}-15y^2 + 6y^{5/2}) \right|_0^1 \\
			&= (10-15+6) - (0-0+0) = 1.
		\end{align*}

	\question Suppose $X$ has the geometric pmf $f_X(x) = \frac{1}{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{x}, \ x = 0,1,2,...$. Determine the probability distribution of $Y= X/(X+1)$. 
	Note that here both $X$ and $Y$ are discrete random variables. To specify the probability distribution of $Y$, specify its pmf.
	
	\begin{solution}
		First we identify a $g^{-1}(\cdot)$ function,
		\begin{align*}
			Y &= \frac{X}{X/(X+1)} \\
			Y(X+1) &= X \\
			YX+Y &= X \\
			Y &= X- XY \\
			Y &= X(1-Y) \\
			\frac{Y}{(1-Y)} &= X. \\
		\end{align*}
		
		Then we may use this function in conjunction with the original PMF to find
		$f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^\frac{y}{(1-y)}$. \\
		Additionally we will use the original ${Y} = \frac{X}{X+1}$ to transform the domain
		to be ${y_i} = \frac{x_i}{x_i+1}, \,\ \forall\ x_i\in X$ or
		$Y = \{0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\ldots\}$. \\
