	\question 
	Let \(X_1,\ldots, X_n\) be iid random variables with continuous cdf \(F_X\), 
	and suppose \(E\,X_i = \mu\).
	Define the random variables \(Y_1,\ldots, Y_n\) by
	
	\[ 
	Y_i = 
	\begin{cases}
		1 & \text{if } X_i > \mu \\
		0 & \text{if } X_i \leq\mu.
	\end{cases}
	\]
	
	Find the distribution of \(\sum^{n}_{i=1}Y_i\).
	
	\begin{solution}
		The distribution can be calculated if \(F_X\) is known, the relationship between the distributions is,
		\[\sum^{n}_{i=1}Y_i \sim \text{binom}(n,p = P(X>\mu)).\]

	If \(X\) has pdf \(f_X(x)\) and \(Y\), independent of \(X\), has pdf \(f_Y(y)\), 
	establish formulas, similar to (5.2.3), for the random variable \(Z\) 
	in each of the following situations.

	drawn from a population with finite variance \(\sigma^2\). We know that \(E\,S^2 = \sigma^2\). 
	Prove that \(E\,S \leq \sigma\), and
	if \(\sigma^2 > 0\), then \(E\,S < \sigma\).

	Establish the following recursion relations for means and variances. 
	Let \(\bar{X}_n\) and \(S_n^2\) be the mean and variance, respectively, of \(X_1,\ldots,X_n\). 
	Then suppose another observation, \(X_{n+1}\), becomes available. Show that
	
	\begin{parts}
