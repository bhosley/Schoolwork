2) Which suburbs have low crime rates?

All Values below the median appear to be signicantly lower than what would be expected if only considering the mean.
There were no low-side outliers, as it would imply a negative Crime rate.
For this reason I consider all neighborhoods in the first quartile to be low crime. The second quartile is fairly low as well.

4) Explore Data and determine which variables may be useful for predicting crim1

The variables that appear to differ signicantly in relation to crim1 appear to be:
indus, rad, and tax    with a higher level of significance, and
nox, age, and dis      with a lower level of significance.

9) Perform kNN. Which value k seems to perform best on this dataset?

k 10 -> 7 false negatives, 3 false positives
k 15 -> 10 and 6 
k 5 -> 1 and 4 
k 2 -> 3 and 4
k 4 -> 3 and 6
k 3 -> 1 and 5

k = 5 gave the best results.

11) Compare kNN and Naive Bayes.

16 false positives, 6 false negatives out of 100 tests.
Laplace correction did not improve the quality of the results.
The innacuracy here is not too surprising given the general weaknesses associate with NBC, specifically datasets with numeric features and the assumption of independent and equally important features.
Initially I had a surprising perfect prediction before realizing that column 2 was still being included in the analysis.
