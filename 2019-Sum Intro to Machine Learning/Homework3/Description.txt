4) Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship to MPG?
Cylinders, Acceleration, Year, and Origin all appear to be statistically significant predictors of MPG. 

5) What does the coefficient for the year variable suggest?
The coefficient means the two variables correlate, higher years yeild higher MPG, suggesting that cars become more fuel efficient over time.

6) Write down the linear regression equation for this model. 
MPG = -18.711572 - 0.445205*cylinders + 0.018913*displacement - 0.009394*horsepower - 0.006732*weight + 0.117888*acceleration + 0.762458*year + 1.396799*origin  

7) Find the predicted MPG for a vehicle with specific features.
    cylinders: 4
    displacement: 100
    horsepower: 50
    weight: 3000
    acceleration: 15
    year: 75
    origin: 1
Predicted MPG: 21.08

9) What is the tree size of the C5.0 model?
Tree size: 21

10) Calculate the error rate
Error rate: 17.5%

11) Predict origin based on provided attributes.
My model predicts an origin of 2 for the car with those attributes.
