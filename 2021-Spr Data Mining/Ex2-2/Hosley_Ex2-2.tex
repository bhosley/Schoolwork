\subsection*{Q1: Modify/rewrite the grouping-set-query in the example with ROLLUP (Let’s call it rollup-query). Run it, check the results, and explain the differences.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Replace GROUPING SETS part with ROLLUP:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Delete GROUPING SETS line.
		\item Add ‘WITH ROLLUP’ in GROUP BY line.
		\item For syntax, see \href{https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Enhanced+Aggregation\%2C+Cube\%2C+Grouping+and+Rollup}{link}.
	\end{itemize}
	\item First line of the result should be like below
	\begin{itemize}
		\item NULL NULL NULL 8000
	\end{itemize}
	\item Explain the differences of the results between the grouping-set-query and the roll-up-query with your query results. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Not with general cases like A, B, C or a, b, c 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Regarding query results, please include first 10 lines or so only.
\end{itemize}

\begin{minted}[breaklines,bgcolor=light-gray]{shell-session}
SELECT driverid, event, count(*) as occurance
FROM csc533.bhosl2_geolocation
GROUP BY driverid, event WITH ROLLUP
LIMIT 10;
\end{minted}

\subsection*{Q2: Modify/rewrite the rollup-query (or grouping-set-query) with GROUPING SETS (Let’s call it rollup-like-query) to produce same results of rollup-query.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Query result should be same.
	\item Regarding query results, please include first 10 lines or so only.
\end{itemize}

\begin{minted}[breaklines,bgcolor=light-gray]{shell-session}
SELECT driverid, event, count(*) as occurance
FROM csc533.bhosl2_geolocation
GROUP BY driverid, event
GROUPING SETS ((driverid, event), driverid)
LIMIT 10;
\end{minted}

\subsection*{Q3: Modify/rewrite the grouping-set-query with CUBE. Run it, check the results, and explain the differences and similarities.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain the differences and similarities of the queries and query results among GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP and CUBE
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Explain with your query results. (not general cases like A, B, C or a, b, c)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Regarding query results, please include first 10 lines or so only.
\end{itemize}

\begin{minted}[breaklines,bgcolor=light-gray]{shell-session}
SELECT driverid, event, count(*) as occurance
FROM csc533.bhosl2_geolocation
GROUP BY driverid, event WITH CUBE
LIMIT 10;
