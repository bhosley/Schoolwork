This \printdoctype explores scalable methods in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) 
and heterogeneous-agent reinforcement learning (HARL) for enhanced adaptability and efficiency. 
Inspired by successful projects like AlphaStar, we investigate key aspects to make advanced MARL 
techniques more accessible. Our research questions focus on algorithm generalizability, 
the impact of adversarial non-stationarity, and improving scalability. 
Contributions include evaluating MARL and HARL algorithms, applying advanced training methods, 
and developing adaptive curricula. The document comprises a literature review and a 
detailed research plan, aiming to advance multi-agent systems for practical applications.
