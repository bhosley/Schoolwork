We intend to use this section for accomplish three things;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Convince the committee that this is important
    \item Convince the committee that this is an open question
    \item Convince the committee that we understand the current state of the literature and the scope of the intended research. (Implicitly indicating the feasibility of the research)
\end{enumerate}
