\chapter{Literature Review}

Here we will construct the academic funnel as discussed with Dr Cox.

General toward specific;
I think I want to construct a chart, perhaps instead of a proper
funnel/inverted pyramid, I will use a flowchart.

Has there ever been a properly used sankey for this purpose?


Include a lit review table.

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
    Paper & contributions & ref 
\end{tabular}

We intend to use this section for accomplish three things;
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Convince the committee that this is important
    \item Convince the committee that this is an open question
    \item Convince the committee that we understand th ecurrent state of the literature and the scope of the intended research. (Implicitly indicating the feasibility of the research)
\end{enumerate}
