\section{Theoretical implications}

For each proposed contribution:

\begin{itemize}
    \item (Multiple pages probably) on the motivation and the specific problem. Call back to the appropriate references.
    \item Specify the academic contributions (Bulletized format makes for easier, clearer conveyance)
    \item Summary of specific methodology to be employed by each part
    \item Expected results. That is, the expected implications of whatever the results will be. We aren't predicting the answer to the questions, just what the answers will tell us.
\end{itemize}
